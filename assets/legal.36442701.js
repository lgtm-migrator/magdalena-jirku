We use HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) to securely transfer data on the Internet. This means that the entire transmission of all data from your browser to our web server is secured \u2013 nobody can \u201Clisten in\u201D.</p><p>We have thus introduced an additional layer of security and meet privacy requirements through technology design <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=EN&amp;tid=121692304" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Article 25 Section 1 GDPR</a>. With the use of TLS (Transport Layer Security), which is an encryption protocol for safe data transfer on the internet, we can ensure the protection of confidential information. You can recognise the use of this safeguarding tool by the little lock-symbol, which is situated in your browser\u2019s top left corner in the left of the internet address (e.g. examplepage.uk), as well as by the display of the letters https (instead of http) as a part of our web address. If you want to know more about encryption, we recommend you to do a Google search for \u201CHypertext Transfer Protocol Secure wiki\u201D to find good links to further information.</p>',17),l=[s],f={meta:[]},m="",y=t({__name:"legal",setup(c,{expose:e}){return o({meta:[]}),e({frontmatter:{meta:[]},excerpt:void 0}),(u,p)=>(i(),a("div",n,l))}});export{y as default,m as excerpt,f as frontmatter};
